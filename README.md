# AI-Debate-Club
Two LLMs (e.g., Claude vs Claude with different personas) argue on opposite sides of a topic. Users pick the topic (“Is pineapple pizza valid?”), watch the debate unfold in turns, then vote who won. Fun hook: Share debates as short transcripts/memes. Tech: Simple React frontend + Claude API backend with turn-based prompting.
